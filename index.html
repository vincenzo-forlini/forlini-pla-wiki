<h2>Veilstone Harbor</h2>
<p>The constant activity of cargo ships and cruise liners contributes to a dynamic and vibrant atmosphere.</p>
<p>Veilstone Harbor, also known as "Darsena Rupepoli," is the port area of Veilstone City and the main trade center of the eastern coast of Sinnoh. Cargo ships and cruise liners full of tourists and trainers dock here. These visitors are welcomed into the city after obtaining the necessary permits at the Arrival Office, which also functions as a mail pickup office. The harbor has a fairly barren structure, with warehouses, containers, and a constant flow of workers. Most of the containers belong to Galaxias Novus. As a result, at night, the area is full of recruits patrolling the perimeter, but the keen-eyed will notice other logos like those of Silph and Altru Inc. Especially at night, the area is not very friendly to ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>Many goods are directly delivered to the Marketplace, for which a direct connection supervised by Galaxias has been opened.</p>
<p>The harbor connects to the north and west (via the Marketplace) with Veilstone City, and to the south with Route 214 and the Maniac Tunnel. A part of the harbor is accessible only to Pok√©mon Trainers, as it is a training area for workers.</p>

<h2>Veilstone City</h2>
<img src="https://github.com/AdAstra-LD/LATA-Resources/blob/main/Documentation/Region/Region_Pics/Veilstone_city.png" alt="Veilstone City">
<p>The city thrives as a major industrial hub, but its polluted channels and air reflect its environmental challenges.</p>
<p>Veilstone City is a highly industrial city located near a promontory in the northwestern part of Sinnoh. It connects to the west with Route 215 and to the south with Veilstone Harbor.</p>
<p>The canals running through it are artificial, built to facilitate faster trade. The city has deteriorated over time, with its difficulties evident to all: polluted canals, unbreathable air, trash on the ground, and unsavory characters infesting the area during the early hours. On the other hand, as an international trading point, it is a dynamic environment that always sees new trainers and tourists using it as a starting point to explore the Sinnoh region.</p>
<p>A small tree planted by Galaxias Novus does its best to survive.</p>

<h4 id="homebase">The Homebase</h4>
<p>In Veilstone, there is a house rented by Fortis for Platinum Berlitz to use as their base. Inside, there is a catalog to purchase furniture and decorate the house. In the future, the panel will also allow inviting plot characters home to interact with them.</p>

<h4>The Marketplace</h4>
<p>In this covered market, every Trainer can find what they need. Some services are available only during the day, while others are only available at night. During the day, Berries will be sold, and an enthusiast will be present to buy Treasures at double the price.</p>
<p>Only in the evening will the Incense kiosk manager appear.</p>
<p>Shops available at any time include the Battle Items kiosk, the Vitamins kiosk, and the appliance seller who allows Rotom to change forms. On Friday night, the *mysterious guy* who sells Treasures will be present.</p>

<h2>The Pristine Lounge Bar</h2>
<p>This Jazz Club was once the Fighting-type Gym of Veilstone, led by Gym Leader Maylene. With the closure of the League, the building was dismantled and bought for a few coins by musician Lark Klavaro, who came from Sunyshore City. Lark was looking for a place to play regularly and build a fanbase. Soon, his family also decided to move to Veilstone. Maylene started hanging out at the club, and after her father left due to apparent financial difficulties, Lark offered her a place to stay. Since then, the two have forged an unbreakable bond.</p>
<p>Platinum Berlitz visits the Pristine Lounge to obtain their Starter, but Lark's stubbornness forces them to participate in the tournament held at the venue. After completing Chapter 4, you can return to the Lounge to repeat the tournament once a week, every Saturday night. As victories in the tournament increase, Lark and his band's teams will become stronger, and the battles more challenging (you cannot save before completing the rounds). After a certain number of victories, Velia will replace Lark as the tournament boss.</p>
<p>The Lounge is also where Lark receives his fans. It is here that you can get his Autograph, necessary to obtain the Bicycle.</p>

<h2>Galaxias Pilot Plant</h2>
<p>The Pilot Plant is an industrial complex, primarily responsible for the city's pollution, located on the Veilstone promontory. Built 50 years before the events of the game, it formed the cornerstone on which the Galaxias Novus organization was founded and kickstarted the city's economy. The plant was initially built as an oil refinery to produce fuel.</p>
<p>However, over time, Galaxias repurposed this complex with the specific goal of testing new technologies deep within the Labs. It consists of five floors in total: G, 1F, 2F, 3F, and UG, with multiple staircases to navigate the complex. Lately, it has become disorganized and neglected, with piles of junk and barrels scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>The Plant is the setting for Platinum's first mission. However, with recruits attacking the agent and Commanders Mars and Jupiter visiting to celebrate the completion of the Red Chains and oversee their transfer, the objective of not arousing suspicion proves extremely unrealistic.</p>

<h4>Processing Complex</h4>
<p>This ground-floor room is the heart of the "regular" oil distillation operations. The maze of pipes separates different fractions using heat from furnaces powered by Slugma. Excess steam is vented through grates in the floor. To cross the grates without getting burned, the intensity of the corresponding furnace must be reduced.</p>

<h4>Production Control Hub</h4>
<p>A room located on the top floor of the building, where industrial processes are monitored via video dashboards.</p>
<p>When Galaxias initiates the Legends Arise program and assigns Fortis as the supervisor for the Red Chain development, it informally becomes Fortis' personal office. It is here that the Agent leaves the briefcase containing the fake Red Chains for Platinum to retrieve.</p>
